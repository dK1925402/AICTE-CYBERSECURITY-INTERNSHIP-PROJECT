# Secure Data Hiding in Image Using Steganography  

This project enables users to securely hide and retrieve sensitive information within images using steganography and encryption. It includes a user-friendly GUI for enhanced accessibility and ease of use.

## Features  
- **Text Encryption**: Protect sensitive text with password-based encryption.  
- **Steganography**: Discreetly embed encrypted text within images.  
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Easy-to-use interface for hiding and retrieving text.  
- **Two-Layer Security**: Combines encryption and steganography for enhanced protection.

## Problem Statement  
Traditional methods of data security often expose the presence of sensitive information. This project solves this by securely embedding encrypted data within images, making the data virtually undetectable.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**: Core programming language.  
- **Pillow**: For image processing.  
- **Cryptography (Fernet)**: For text encryption and decryption.  
- **Tkinter**: For creating the GUI.  

## How It Works  
1. **Hiding Data**:  
   - Upload an image.  
   - Enter the text to hide and set a password for encryption.  
   - Save the image with hidden data.  

2. **Retrieving Data**:  
   - Upload the image with hidden data.  
   - Enter the password to decrypt and reveal the hidden text.  

## Wow Factor  
- Seamlessly combines encryption and steganography for dual-layer security.  
- Easy-to-use GUI for non-technical users.  
- Ensures data remains hidden and safe from unauthorized access.  

## End Users  
- Professionals handling sensitive information.  
- Organizations securing confidential data.  
- Individuals seeking secure personal communication.  

## Results  
- Successfully hides encrypted text in images.  
- Retrieves hidden text securely with password authentication.  

## Future Scope  
- Add support for hiding larger files like PDFs or documents.  
- Implement support for multiple image formats.  
- Introduce advanced encryption algorithms for greater security.
